# 📦 Asset Tracking System - Full Stack Rental & Lifecycle Management

FastAPI | JWT Auth | RBAC | Async SQLAlchemy | PostgreSQL | React + TypeScript | Vite

A production-ready full-stack application for managing rentable assets end-to-end. Users can browse assets, create bookings, pay deposits and rent, and request returns. Admins manage assets, categories, rental plans, allocation, return processing, payments, and user operations through role-protected workflows.

This project demonstrates real-world backend architecture with secure auth, async database operations, transactional business flows, and a modern frontend.

## 🔥 Features

- 🔐 JWT Authentication: Access token + refresh token flow with secure password hashing.
- 👥 Role-Based Access Control: Separate permissions for Admin and User roles.
- 🔄 Asset Lifecycle Management: Available -> Allocated -> Returned status transitions.
- 🧾 Booking Workflow: Create, list, cancel, and return-request flows for users.
- 🧩 Allocation Operations: Admin assigns specific assets to approved bookings.
- 💳 Payment Handling: Deposit and rent payments with booking-state enforcement.
- ↩️ Return Processing: Late fine and damage charge handling with deposit refund logic.
- 📊 Payment Breakdown: Detailed booking-level payment/charge summary.
- 🛡️ User Management: Admin role assignment, activation toggle, and user history views.
- 🎨 Modern Frontend: React + TypeScript UI with protected routes and admin dashboard.
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL Storage: Persistent relational data using SQLAlchemy models.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 👤 For Users

1. Register/Login - Create an account and authenticate.
2. Browse Assets - View available assets, categories, and plans.
3. Create Booking - Select plan and pickup date, optionally request a specific asset.
4. Pay Deposit - Confirm booking by paying deposit.
5. Pay Rent - Complete payment after admin allocation.
6. Request Return - Trigger return flow after usage.
7. Track Status - View booking progression and payment breakdown.

### 👨‍💼 For Admins

1. Configure Catalog - Manage categories, rental plans, and assets.
2. Review Bookings - Access all bookings and request state.
3. Allocate Asset - Assign available assets to booked requests.
4. Process Returns - Calculate fines/damage and process deposit refunds.
5. Manage Users - Update user info, assign role, activate/deactivate accounts.
6. Audit Activity - View allocations and user history.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Backend

- ⚡ FastAPI - Async REST API framework.
- 🧠 SQLAlchemy Async + AsyncPG - Async ORM and PostgreSQL driver.
- 🧭 Alembic - Database migrations.
- ✅ Pydantic - Data validation and schema contracts.
- 🔒 Passlib + bcrypt - Password hashing.
- 🔑 python-jose - JWT token handling.

### 🎨 Frontend

- ⚛️ React 19 + TypeScript - UI and type-safe client logic.
- ⚡ Vite - Fast dev server and build tool.
- 🧭 React Router - Client-side routing.
- 🧪 React Hook Form + Zod - Form handling and validation.
- 🎬 Framer Motion - UI motion and transitions.

### 🔐 Security

- 🪪 Access token in Authorization header.
- 🍪 Refresh token via HTTP-only cookie.
- 🚧 Role-gated endpoints using dependency-based RBAC.
- 🧷 Input validation and ORM-backed query safety.

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

1. User registers through /auth/register.
2. User logs in through /auth/login.
3. Server returns access token and sets refresh token cookie.
4. Frontend sends Authorization: Bearer token on protected requests.
5. On access token expiry, frontend calls /auth/refresh and retries.
6. Logout revokes refresh token and clears cookie.

Register -> Login -> Access Token + Refresh Cookie -> Protected APIs -> Refresh -> Continue

## 🔄 Booking, Allocation, Payment, Return Flow

1. User creates booking with rental plan and pickup date.
2. User pays deposit to move booking from pending to booked.
3. Admin allocates an available asset to move booking to allocated.
4. User pays rent to mark booking as picked_up.
5. User requests return when done.
6. Admin processes return, computes late fine/damage, updates asset availability, and records refund/charges.
